:books: Same functionality. Better performance for you. :books:

Over the past few months, we've been improving Binder's architecture and infrastructure. We're retiring this repo as it will no longer be actively developed. Future development will occur under the [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/) organization.

* All development of the Binder technology will occur in the [binderhub repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub)
* Documentation for *users* will occur in the [jupyterhub binder repo](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder) 
* All conversations and chat for users will occur in the [jupyterhub binder gitter channel](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder)

Thanks for updating your bookmarked links.
